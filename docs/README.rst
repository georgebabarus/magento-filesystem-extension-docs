Introduction
============

Storing media files involve some work when you decide to scale horizontally.
Also having to care about disk space and disk mounting may be useless when you are already using cloud infrastructure.

Using cloud storage like Amazon S3 Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage should be easy to configure and use.

See bellow some of the key advantages of using this Magento 2 extension to integrate with various cloud file storage systems in a platform agnostic manner.
